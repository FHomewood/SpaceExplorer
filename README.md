It's a top down space exploration game in which the user plays a mining droid that travels through space using orbital mechanics to safely maneuver to different gravitational bodies. 

## Aims
This software is produced by me, an individual developer, for the purposes of self improvement. Below is a list of aims that I hope this project will help me achieve:

* Repair the memory of a forgotten project.
* Improve understanding of simulating orbital mechanics.
* Commitment to fulfilling a long-term project.
* Develop inventory systems for the first time.
